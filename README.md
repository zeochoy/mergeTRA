## Usage
Download and souce the scripts.
Remember to load [GenomicRanges](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GenomicRanges.html) and [plyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plyr/index.html) before sourcing.
```R
library(GenomicRanges)
library(plyr)
source("readBreakDancerTRA.R")
source("readDellyTRA.R")
source("methodsMergeTRA.R")
```

### windowsize?
Windowsize should generally be in the range of the read length to 2x read length. e.g. For PE150, windowsize is about 150-300bp.
